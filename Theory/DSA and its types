### Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in computer science that involve organizing and processing data efficiently. Here are some key data structures and algorithms, along with their types:

1. **Arrays:**
   - **Definition:** An array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
   - **Types:** One-dimensional array, two-dimensional array.

2. **Linked Lists:**
   - **Definition:** A linked list is a linear collection of nodes, where each node points to the next node in the sequence.
   - **Types:** Singly linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list.

3. **Stacks:**
   - **Definition:** A stack is a collection of elements with two main operations: push (adding an element to the top) and pop (removing the top element).
   - **Types:** LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack.

4. **Queues:**
   - **Definition:** A queue is a collection of elements with two main operations: enqueue (adding an element to the back) and dequeue (removing the front element).
   - **Types:** FIFO (First In, First Out) queue, priority queue.

5. **Trees:**
   - **Definition:** A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root node and branches representing a hierarchy.
   - **Types:** Binary tree, AVL tree, B-tree, Trie.

6. **Graphs:**
   - **Definition:** A graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges.
   - **Types:** Directed graph, undirected graph, weighted graph.

7. **Hash Tables:**
   - **Definition:** A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values, allowing for efficient retrieval of values based on keys.
   - **Types:** Open addressing, chaining.

8. **Searching Algorithms:**
   - **Binary Search:** Efficient search in sorted arrays.
   - **Linear Search:** Basic search algorithm for unordered lists.

9. **Sorting Algorithms:**
   - **Bubble Sort:** Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   - **Merge Sort:** Divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the input into smaller parts, sorts them, and then merges them.

10. **Graph Algorithms:**
    - **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Traversal algorithm that visits all vertices of a graph in breadthward motion.
    - **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
